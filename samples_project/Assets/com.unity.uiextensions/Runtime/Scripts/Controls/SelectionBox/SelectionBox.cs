/*
 * What the SelectionBox component does is allow the game player to select objects using an RTS style click and drag interface:
 * 
 * We want to be able to select Game Objects of any type,
 * We want to be able to drag select a group of game objects to select them,
 * We want to be able to hold the shift key and drag select a group of game objects to add them to the current selection,
 * We want to be able to single click a game object to select it,
 * We want to be able to hold the shift key and single click a game object to add it to the current selection, 
 * We want to be able to hold the shift key and single click an already selected game object to remove it from the current selection.
 * 
 * Most importantly, we want this behaviour to work with UI, 2D or 3D gameObjects, so it has to be smart about considering their respective screen spaces.
 * 
 * Add this component to a Gameobject with a Canvas with RenderMode.ScreenSpaceOverlay
 * And implement the IBoxSelectable interface on any MonoBehaviour to make it selectable.
 * 
 * Improvements that could be made:
 * 
 * Control clicking a game object to select all objects of that type or tag.
 * Compatibility with Canvas Scaling
 * Filtering single click selections of objects occupying the same space. (So that, for example, you're only click selecting the game object found closest to the camera)
 *
