/// Demo - https://youtu.be/uVTV7Udx78k?t=1m33s Dynamic scaling of text or image (including button) based on curves. works on scrollrect scale so you can pretty much use it for any ui type. 
/// Notes In some cases it can create spikes due to redrawing on change, it is recommended to use it on simple objects in separated canvases to avoid redrawing full canvas.

    /// Dynamic scaling of text or image (including button) based on curves
    /// 
    /// Fields
    /// - animCurve - animation curve for scale (if isUniform set to false, will apply only to X scale)
    /// - speed - animation speed
    /// - isLoop - animation will play infinitely (in order to make it work set your animation curve to loop)
    /// - playAtAwake - starts automatically with script becoming active. Otherwise you need to call Play() method.
    /// - isUniform - if false animCurve will modify object X scale and animCurveY - Y scale.
    /// 
    /// 
    /// Notes
    /// - If you want to stop the animation call the ResetTween() method. 
    /// - In some cases it can create spikes due to redrawing on change, it is recommended  to use it on simple objects in separated canvases to 
    /// avoid redrawing full canvas. 
    /// - If you want to scale object only in 1 axis select non unifor and use linear curve from 1 to 1 to lock the scale.
