# Measure

Draw lines on the map and show distance.

## How it works

1. Set your API Key.
2. While holding shift, click on the map to begin drawing. Keep clicking to add vertices. The accumulated geodetic distance will be shown. The distance calculation uses the [ArcGISGeometryEngine](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity/api-reference/gameengine/geometry/arcgisgeometryengine#distancegeodetic). This sample is only setup to work with mouse and keyboard.
