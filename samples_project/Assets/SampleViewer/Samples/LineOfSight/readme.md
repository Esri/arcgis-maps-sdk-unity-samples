# Line of sight

Show a line of sight between two objects. Check if the line of sight is obstructed by the ArcGIS 3D model layer.

## How it works

1. Check the box for "Use Mesh Colliders" on the `Arc GIS Map View` component.
2. Create a parent object with an `Arc GIS Location` Component.
3. Create child game objects in the scene that use `Transform` components.
4. Move an object around the scene so that it comes in and out of the "view" of another object.
5. Add any objects that may interfere with the raycast check to the "Ignore Raycast" layer.
6. Check for any obstructions between objects using the `Physics.Raycast` method.
7. Use the `RaycastHit.point` property to determine where the line of sight from the first object collides.
