## How to use the sample

1. Open the **ThirdPerson** level.
2. Click on **ArcGISMap** 
3. Set your API key under the **Authentication** section.
4. Click play and move the character by using the WASD keys. Jump with the space key.

## How it works

This samples makes use of Unity's [Starter Assets - Third Person Character Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526).

1. Set up the **ArcGIS Map** for the exploration area.
2. Create a Third Person Character with its control and attach to **ArcGIS Map**. 
3. Add the Third Person Character to the level.
   - Mesh colliders need to be enabled in the **ArcGIS Map**.
   - If you want to place the character on a specific location, attach the [**ArcGIS Location Component**](https://developers.arcgis.com/unreal-engine/maps/location-component/) to specify it.
   - The Third Person Character provided in this sample detects the terrain mesh collider before it lands on the ground.
