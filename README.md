Here is a Unity project containing a set of samples showing you how to accomplish various things using the combined features of Unity and the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Refer to the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity's documentation on getting started](https://developers.arcgis.com/unity-sdk/get-started/) on how to download `Unity` and the `ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unity`. This project does not contain the Maps SDK so it needs to be included like it would into any other project.
3. Launch Unity and play the `SampleViewer` level.
